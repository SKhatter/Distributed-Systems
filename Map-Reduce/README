This  project  is  designed  to have a basic  familiarity with  the  MapReduce  paradigm  via  the  Hadoop framework.  Given files include- Docker files to enable to build and start a Hadoop cluster that is pre-loaded with the Hadoop word-count example and text data  files. The project includes:
1) To use the Docker console to start up a Hadoop cluster consisting of one Hadoop/HDFS master node and four(4) Hadoop/HDFS client nodes. 
2) To  run  the  WordCount  example,  as  is,  without  modi cation,  and  con rm  that your cluster is working. Your third task is to modify the WordCount example to create a BigramExample, which counts the number of bigrams within the corpus.  At the conclusion of its exectution, it should output three pieces of information, one per line:  
(i) the total number of bigrams
(ii) the most common bigram 
(iii) the number of bigrams required to add up to 10% of all bigrams
