This  project  is  designed  to  give  you  a  basic  familiarity  with  the  MapReduce  paradigm  via  the  Hadoop
framework.  We give you Docker les to enable you to build and start a Hadoop cluster that is pre-loaded
with the Hadoop word-count exampland text data  les.
Your  rst task is to use the Docker console to start up a Hadoop cluster consisting of one Hadoop/HDFS
master node and four(4) Hadoop/HDFS client nodes.
Your  second  task  is  to  run  the  WordCount  example,  as  is,  without  modi cation,  and  con rm  that
your cluster is working.
Your third task is to modify the WordCount example to create a BigramExample, which counts the
number of bigrams within the corpus.  At the conclusion of its exectution, it should output three pieces
of information, one per line:  (1 )the total number of bigrams, (2)i the most common bigram, and (3)
the number of bigrams required to add up to 10% of all bigrams
