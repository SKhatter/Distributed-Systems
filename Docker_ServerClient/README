Ubuntu  Docker  containers will  serve  as the  nodes.  They  will be  networked
via the Docker bridge network.  And a Docker data volume container will be used to enable the nodes
to share data, simulting a distributed  le system.
This project is designed to help you to bootstrap that process.  You will (i) complete the Docker tutorial,
(ii) create Docker les to describe a node, (ii) develop a really simple client and server, (iii) modify the
Docker le into two  les, one for a client and one for a server, (iv) demonstrate that your client andserver
can interact.
