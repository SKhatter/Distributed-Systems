Ubuntu  Docker  containers will  serve  as the  nodes.  They  will be  networked via the Docker bridge network.  And a Docker data volume container will be used to enable the nodes to share data, simulting a distributed  file system. This project is designed to bootstrap that process.  The project includes:
(i) completion of the Docker tutorial
(ii) creation of the  Docker files to describe a node
(iii) development of a really simple client and server
(iv) modification of the Docker file into two  files, one for a client and one for a server
(v) demonstration that client andserver can interact.
